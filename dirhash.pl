# Release history:
#   Version 0.1 - 2012-01-29 - Initial release

# This script was written to provide a way to hash an entire directory tree.  This can
#   be handy when you have a directory where you need to verify that the contents and
#   filenames are identical but you may not want to touch the data using a program like
#   rsync.
#
# This was designed as a fast way to get a yes or no answer as to whether the contents
#   two directories are identical NOT as a way to synchronize them.  If one filename is
#   different, one byte inside any file is different, or there are missing/additional
#   files the output will be different.
#
# To test it try doing the following test.  Assume you have a directory called "data"
#   copy that directory to "data-copy" with "cp -R data data-copy".  Run dirhash.pl
#   on both directories and verify that you get the same hash.  Then modify a file,
#   a filename, add or delete a file from either and re-run dirhash.pl on them both.
#   The unmodified directory will have the same hash, the modified one will not.
#
# This script requires the Digest::SHA module.

# And here comes the real code...

# Check to see if we have the Digest::SHA module

  require Digest::SHA;
